/* transparent capture at the edge of the ip stack.

   lwip only accepts packets addressed to its own interface, and a listener
   only matches one exact port. an application connecting to 203.0.113.7:443
   is neither, so without help the stack drops the syn as not for us.

   instead of changing lwip, every captured flow gets a table entry and its
   packets are rewritten on the way in and out:

     app -> stack   A:a -> D:d     becomes   S:s -> L:P
     stack -> app   L:P -> S:s     becomes   D:d -> A:a

   L:P is the one listener the stack has, S is a reserved synthetic peer
   address and s is a port that belongs to the entry's slot, so every flow is
   a distinct connection inside the stack even when two apps talk to the same
   destination port. the original tuple is never lost: it is the entry's key,
   and the stack's own tcp does all of the tcp work.

   the translation is bounded by the table and applies only to packets that
   belong to an entry. nothing here touches lwip, so the rules are tested on
   the host with real packet bytes */
