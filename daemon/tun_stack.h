/* the only place senko touches the vendored ip stack. it takes frames from
   the utun device, captures the app's tcp connections with their original
   destinations, and hands the stack's answers back as frames. no servers, no
   policies, no transports and no routes live here.

   the frame is the unit at this boundary: this module parses the four byte
   family header of every inbound frame once and writes it for every outbound
   frame once. the device below only moves whole frames.

   one thread owns everything here: the device, every lwip call, the timers,
   the pending queue and the flow callbacks. lwip in this port has no locking
   of its own, so every entry point checks the caller. other threads talk to
   the owner through daemon/tun_loop.c.

   capture works by bounded translation, see core/tun_nat.h. a new syn is
   held and reported to the owner, who accepts it (the stack then answers the
   app from the original destination) or rejects it (the app gets a reset from
   that destination). the stack never completes a handshake the owner has not
   agreed to */
