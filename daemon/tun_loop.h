/* the thread that owns the tunnel. tun_loop_run() is the only code that reads
   or writes the utun descriptor, calls into lwip, runs its timers and drains
   the pending queue, all on the thread that calls it.

   every other thread reaches it through tun_loop_post(): a bounded queue of
   commands, each stamped with the generation of the run it was meant for, so
   a command aimed at a run that already ended can never act on the next one.

   stopping follows one order: stop taking commands and packets, abort the
   flows and the stack's connections, remove the interface, drop the pending
   frames, close the descriptor. stopping twice is harmless */
