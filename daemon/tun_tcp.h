/* the bridge between a captured tcp flow and senko's own protocol core.

   the app's side is the flow's byte stream in daemon/tun_stack.h. the
   server's side is a session from core/session.h over a transport, the same
   session the socks frontend in daemon/loop.c drives, so vless, vision and
   the transports are not written a second time.

   a new flow is held while its server connection opens on the opener pool.
   a socks or http proxy must also answer CONNECT before the app's handshake
   completes; a failure answers the app with a reset. no byte of the app ever
   leaves any other way than through that server connection

   everything here runs on the tunnel's owning thread, driven by the hooks and
   callbacks tun_tcp_init() installs in the loop configuration */
